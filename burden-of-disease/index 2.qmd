## Development Roadmap — Burden of Disease

| Phase | Feature | Status |
|-------|---------|--------|
| **v0.1** | YLL computation using SA life tables & vital stats | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.1** | Summary table: top conditions by YLL | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.2** | DALY estimation (YLL + YLD) with disability weights | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.2** | Ranked bar chart of DALYs by condition | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.3** | Age-standardised rates (ASR) using WHO standard population | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.3** | Province-level ASR comparison dot-plot | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.4** | Temporal trends in BoD indicators | 🔲 Planned |
| **v0.5** | Downloadable BoD summary tables (CSV / PDF) | 🔲 Planned |

*Data pipeline:* `R/Age_Standardise_Rates.r` → `data/processed/`

## Overview

The Burden of Disease section quantifies the **health impact** of notifiable conditions beyond simple case counts. Three complementary indicators are computed:

| Indicator | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **YLL** (Years of Life Lost) | Premature mortality impact, computed from SA life tables and vital registration data |
| **DALYs** (Disability-Adjusted Life Years) | Combined mortality (YLL) + morbidity (YLD) burden |
| **ASR** (Age-Standardised Rates) | Rates adjusted for population age structure to enable fair comparisons across provinces |

## Methodological Note
All estimates depend on data quality and completeness. Assumptions, disability weights, and life table sources are documented on the [Methods](../methods.html) page.

## Years of Life Lost (YLL) {#yll}

*Coming soon — YLL computations using South African life tables (Stats SA) and vital status from NMC death notifications.*

---

## DALYs {#dalys}

*Coming soon — Disability-adjusted life years combining YLL with YLD estimates. Disability weights sourced from GBD 2019.*

---

## Age-Standardised Rates {#asr}

*Coming soon — rates per 100 000 adjusted using the WHO World Standard Population, enabling province-to-province and time-period comparisons.*
