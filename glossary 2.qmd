## Key Indicators

| Indicator | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Incidence rate** | Number of new cases per 100 000 population over a defined period |
| **CFR** | Proportion of diagnosed cases that result in death |
| **Rt** | Average number of secondary infections caused by one case at time *t* |
| **YLL** | Years of potential life lost due to premature death |
| **YLD** | Years lived in less-than-full health due to illness |
| **DALY** | Total burden = YLL + YLD — one DALY = one year of healthy life lost |
| **ASR** | Rate adjusted for age distribution to allow fair comparison between populations |
| **Completeness** | Proportion of expected surveillance reports actually received |
| **Timeliness** | Time between event occurrence and its entry in the surveillance system |

## Epidemiological Terms

| Term | Definition |
|---|---|
| **Epicurve** | A histogram of case counts over time, used to visualise the course of an outbreak |
| **Signal** | A statistical anomaly in surveillance data that warrants investigation |
| **Nowcast** | An estimate of current case counts adjusted for reporting delays |
| **Forecast** | A probabilistic estimate of future case counts based on current trends |
| **Choropleth** | A map in which areas are shaded proportional to a statistical variable |
| **Drilldown** | Navigating from a summary view to more granular detail (e.g., province → district) |
| **Baseline** | A reference level of disease activity, typically derived from historical data |
