title: "The NMC as an early wanring system"

# Introduction 
The Notifiable Medical conditiosn (NMC) programme digitised their notifications where notificaitosn could be made via an electronic app in 2017 as mandated under the Natianl Health act (no 24 of 2003). The NMC receieves data from laboratories uponn laboratory confirmation of disease.  The NMC also mandates the notification of disease on clinical suspicion based on case definitions adapted from the WHO. While not all clinically suspected cases are confirmed, the notification of suspected cases may present the earliest time at which we identify potenital cases. Thus, the NMC is well positioned as an early warning system of potential outbreaks. 

An early wanring system needs to strike a balance of sensitivty, specificty and timeliness. A system that is too noisy (sensitivite) is not useful. A system that can only detect an outbreak after tha majority of cases have occured is also of limited value. 

As of 2024, the NMC has been in operation for 7 years and currently received ~ 10 000 notifications per month for ~50 conditions. However, no signal detection pipelines exist. We attempt to test several signal detection methods using NMC data to identify some best practices for signal detection in the NMC using the Rubella outbreak in 2023 as a case study. 

# Aims and Objectives
## Aim
To detemine the best  tool signal detection Fever-Rash outbreaks using NMC data in South Africa. 
## Objective 
1. To describe the reporting delays between clinical notifications and laboratory notifications.
1.1 To determine whether clinicians notify Fever-Rash prior to receiving lab results or afterwards. 
2. To measure the largest time prior to the first emdia report any tool detected the outbreak. 
3. To recommend best practices for Fever Rash siganl detection with NMC. 
4. To identify future data collection or stramline needs to improve signal detection. 

# Methods 
All notifications from for Measles and Rubella from 2019 to 2024 were extracted from the NMC. We describ reporiting delays between clinical notifications and correspoding laboratory notifications. We test a naive, EARS, CUSUM and farrington mixed model as signal detection methods. We will use the existence and earliest detection of the Rubella outbreak as the first media report on school closure in the country.
