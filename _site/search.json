    "text": "Methods & Technical Details\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNoteTechnical details (click to expand)\n\n\n\n\n\nModel: EpiNow2 v1.8.0 – a Bayesian semi-mechanistic model that jointly estimates the effective reproduction number (\\(R_t\\)), infection incidence, and reporting patterns. The model is fitted using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo via CmdStan. A day-of-week effect is enabled (obs_opts(week_effect = TRUE)) to account for lower weekend reporting.\nDisplay smoothing: All custom forecast plots apply a 7-day rolling average to both the observed surveillance series and the EpiNow2 median / credible-interval outputs. This removes residual day-of-week jaggedness and highlights the underlying epidemic trend.\nReporting delay: When empirical symptom→notification dates are available in the NMC data, the delay distribution is estimated via EpiNow2::estimate_delay() (capped at 15 days, max 100 observations). Otherwise a default LogNormal(mean=3, sd=2, max=15) prior is used.\nGeneration time & incubation period: Condition-specific Gamma distributions from published peer-reviewed literature. Key sources: Lessler et al. (2009) for measles/rubella; Vink et al. (2014) for serial intervals; Azman et al. (2013) for cholera; Park et al. (2023) for COVID-19 Omicron estimates. See the parameter table above for full citations. These are fixed inputs — not estimated from the data.\nPriors: \\(R_t\\) priors are weakly informative: Normal(2, 1) for directly-transmitted pathogens, Normal(1.5, 0.5) for vector-borne / lower-Rt conditions. The model quickly learns from data.\nForecast horizon: 28 days (4 weeks) ahead from the last observation date.\nHistory window: 360 days of surveillance data fed to each model run.\nCompleteness / Timeliness: The NMC is a passive surveillance system; under-reporting varies by condition and province. Forecasts represent reported cases, not true incidence.\nRolling forecast animation: Re-runs the model 8 times (weekly snapshots), each using data up to that snapshot date, to visualise how the forecast outlook evolved over time.\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code: R/epinow2_functions.r · R/run_forecasts.r · Data pipeline: R/prepare_dashboard_data.r",
