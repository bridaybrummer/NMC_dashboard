## Project Background

The **SA NMC Epidemiological Intelligence Dashboard** aims to make Notifiable Medical Conditions (NMC) data accessible and actionable for public health officials across South Africa. It provides timely insights into disease trends, hotspots, and forecasts to support effective decision-making and resource allocation.

All coding and analysis is open-source so that any epidemiologist can reproduce the work locally and contribute improvements.
